# Substructd
============

This is an attempt to make a rails3 compliant version of substruct.

[Substruct](http://code.google.com/p/substruct/) is an open source Ruby-on-Rails e-commerce project.

More info will follow later.

## Todo

Things I need to do:

* make it a full on Railtie/Engine
* move rake-tasks to rails generators
  * make sure we can migrate and seed the database
* create a demo-project (to test/develop against)
* use HAML/SASS and convert all views
* use jQuery (convert al js?)
* check if all dependant plugins are ok/compatible with the code
 * for the moment: only cssparser was not found, use csspool instead? or use the old code
* convert all tests to rspec
 * i rather not use fixtures: is that possible? use factory girl instead

Wow! That is a lot of work :)
